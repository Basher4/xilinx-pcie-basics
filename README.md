PCIe <-> FPGA test
==================

A while ago I procured this Xilinx KU5P board from [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001302554837.html)

It's pretty barren, with a few LEDs, 2x QSFP+ ports, PCIe 3 x8 interface, and a mandatory SPI chip. Having an on-board DDR would be nice, but the legend running the store wouldn't be selling it for 150GBP.

Let's get something going on this!
