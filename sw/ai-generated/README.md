# PCI VFIO BAR0 Access Example

This Rust program demonstrates how to safely access PCI device memory using VFIO (Virtual Function I/O) framework. It specifically accesses BAR0 of PCIe device `22:00.0`, reads and writes data at offsets `0x0000` and `0x4000`.

## Features

- Safe access to PCI device memory using the `pci-driver` crate
- No unsafe code required
- Hex dump display of memory contents
- 64-bit value read/write operations
- Verification of write operations

## Prerequisites

### 1. VFIO Kernel Module

Ensure VFIO is enabled in your kernel:

```bash
# Check if VFIO modules are loaded
lsmod | grep vfio

# Load VFIO modules if not present
sudo modprobe vfio
sudo modprobe vfio-pci
```

### 2. IOMMU Support

Enable IOMMU in your system:

**For Intel systems (VT-d):**
Add `intel_iommu=on` to your kernel command line parameters.

**For AMD systems (AMD-Vi):**
Add `amd_iommu=on` to your kernel command line parameters.

Edit `/etc/default/grub`:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"
```

Update GRUB and reboot:
```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

### 3. Bind Device to VFIO Driver

**Option A: Use the automated setup script (Recommended)**

The easiest way is to use the included Python script:

```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x setup_vfio.py

# Run for your specific device (replace 22:00.0 with your device address)
sudo ./setup_vfio.py 22:00.0
```

**Option B: Manual setup**

First, identify your device and its current driver:

```bash
# Find the device
lspci -v | grep -A 10 "22:00.0"

# Note the vendor:device ID (e.g., 10ee:0666)
lspci -n -s 22:00.0
```

Bind the device to VFIO:

```bash
# Replace 10ee:0666 with your actual vendor:device ID
echo "10ee 0666" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id

# Unbind from current driver (if any)
echo "0000:22:00.0" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:22:00.0/driver/unbind

# Bind to VFIO
echo "0000:22:00.0" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind
```

Or use the `vfio-pci` module parameter:
```bash
# Add to kernel parameters
modprobe vfio-pci ids=10ee:0666
```

### 4. Permissions

Ensure your user has access to VFIO devices:

```bash
# Add user to vfio group
sudo usermod -a -G vfio $USER

# Or temporarily change permissions
sudo chmod 666 /dev/vfio/*
```

## Building and Running

### Build the program:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Set up VFIO for your device:

First, identify your PCI device:
```bash
lspci | grep -i <your_device_type>
```

Then run the VFIO setup script:
```bash
# For device at address 22:00.0 (example)
sudo ./setup_vfio.py 22:00.0

# For a different device
sudo ./setup_vfio.py 01:00.0

# With verbose output
sudo ./setup_vfio.py -v 22:00.0

# Full format with segment
sudo ./setup_vfio.py 0000:22:00.0
```

### Run the program:

```bash
# Run with appropriate permissions
sudo ./target/release/pci_rust_example

# Or if user permissions are set up correctly
./target/release/pci_rust_example
```

## Expected Output

The program will:

1. Open the PCIe device at `22:00.0`
2. Access BAR0 and display its size and permissions
3. For offset `0x0000`:
   - Display the first 64 bytes in hex dump format
   - Write a test value (`0x1234567890ABCDEF`) to the first 8 bytes
   - Display the updated contents
   - Verify the write operation
4. Repeat the same process for offset `0x4000`

Example output:
```

## Important Notes

- **Hardware Dependency**: This program is designed for a specific PCIe device at bus address `22:00.0`. Modify the device path if your device is at a different address.

- **BAR0 Size**: The program assumes BAR0 is large enough to accommodate reads/writes at offset `0x4000`. If your device has a smaller BAR0, the program will report an error.

- **Write Permissions**: Some devices may have read-only BARs. The program will detect this and skip write operations.

- **VFIO Setup**: Proper VFIO setup is crucial. The device must be unbound from its native driver and bound to the VFIO driver.

- **Root Privileges**: Depending on your system configuration, you may need to run the program as root or ensure proper user permissions for VFIO device access.

## Troubleshooting

### "No such file or directory" error:
- Verify the device exists: `ls /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:22:00.0`
- Check if the device is bound to VFIO: `lspci -v -s 22:00.0`

### "Permission denied" error:
- Check VFIO device permissions: `ls -la /dev/vfio/`
- Ensure your user is in the `vfio` group: `groups $USER`

### "Device does not have BAR0" error:
- Check the device's BAR configuration: `lspci -v -s 22:00.0`
- Some devices may not have BAR0 or it may be disabled

## Dependencies

- `pci-driver` crate with VFIO backend support
- Linux kernel with VFIO and IOMMU support
- Rust 1.56 or later
